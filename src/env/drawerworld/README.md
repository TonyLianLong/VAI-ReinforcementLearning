# DrawerWorld

DrawerWorld is an environment adapted to provide vision-based control on. The original Metaworld is actually state-based (no vision is exposed through its original API). We adapted only two tasks (DrawerOpen and DrawerClose only) currently. Feel free to contribute to adapt more challenging state-based tasks onto vision-based ones.
